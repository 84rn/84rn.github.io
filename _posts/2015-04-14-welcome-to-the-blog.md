## Hi!

Recently I started thinking about a place, where I could try to summarize my knowledge about coding. I hope that writing about stuff I've learned, describing the issues that I've encountered along the way, will help me consolidate my knowledge. Plus, I always wanted to write, not just code, so I'm hoping this page can turn into something really great. It's time to put an inspiration quote, so: 
<blockquote>
  <p>
     Learning never exhausts the mind.

  <footer><cite title="Leonardo da Vinci">Leonardo da Vinci</cite></footer>
</blockquote>

### What's it about?

Basically, this blog was meant to be a platform for explaining the features off the _new_ **C++11** standard. Explaining to myself, by trying to think of some nice solutions/examples, writing them down, and posting. But you can also find some **riddles**, tech articles and posts about other interesting things, like Arduino projects, or how to feed your cat so it doesn't get [fat](http://img-9gag-ftw.9cache.com/photo/awK50PW_460s.jpg). 

### Final thoughts

The page will be updated soon. Tags, categories and some other less important things need to be added. But the emphasis will be put on the content, so please excuse the ascetic layout. To be honest, I kinda like it, _it really ties the site together_. [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) is really nice, though it's a pain in the ass to get it up and running. I'm not a CSS guru, but I have the feeling I will have to become one if I want this site to look better and better. Anyways, keep coming back for more!
